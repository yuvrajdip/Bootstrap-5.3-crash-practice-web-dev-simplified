//* Columns : 
//* only col-auto _->this is the only thing 
//* which is gonna change the size of the 
//*column box based on the content inside it


//* If you don't hard code a size for what 
//* it should do on smaller screen sizes it's 
//* just going to take up the full width no  
//* matter what 
//* example : col-xl-2 col-lg-4
